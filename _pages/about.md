I'm a 3rd year doctoral candidate in neuroscience at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), where I'm advised by Dr. Aimee McRae-Clark. My research uses a human laboratory paradigm to inform pharmacotherapeutic development for the treatment of addictive disorders, predominantly cannabis use disorder. Beyond basic treatment efficacy, a key emphasis in my work is translatability: from animal models to the human laboratory, from the human laboratory to clinical trials, and bidirectionally across sexes. To conduct this work, I use a combination of methods including behavior analysis, pharmacology, psychophysiology, and ecological momentary assessment.

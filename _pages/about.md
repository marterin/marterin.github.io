I'm a 3rd year doctoral candidate in neuroscience at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), where I'm advised by Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lazcLG0AAAAJ&hl=en">Aimee McRae-Clark</a>.

My research uses a human laboratory paradigm to inform pharmacotherapeutic development for the treatment of addictive disorders, predominantly cannabis use disorder. To conduct this work, I use a combination of methods including behavior analysis, pharmacology, psychophysiology, and ecological momentary assessment.

Beyond basic treatment efficacy, a key focus of my work is translatability: from animal models to the human laboratory, from the human laboratory to clinical trials, and bidirectionally across sexes. A primary goal in my doctoral training has therefore been to develop both technical and study design skills in order to best realize this focus.

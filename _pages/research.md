<b>Sex Differences in the Genetics of Cannabinoid Metabolism<b>

The aim of this study is to examine sex differences in the genetics of exogenous and endogenous cannabinoid metabolism in people that use cannabis heavily. Sex differences are evident in the acute subjective effects of THC, in that females experience greater drug effects even after the development of tolerance, and these subjective effects have been associated with differential prevalence of THC metabolites in blood; associations with peripheral endocannabinoids remain underexplored. We hypothesize that genetic variation in cannabinoid metabolic enzymes may explain sex differences in the subjective effects of THC.

<b>Evaluating Contributors to Relapse in Comorbid Major Depressive Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder<b>

Cannabis Use Disorder is a highly prevalent public health concern with limited treatment options, and the
treatment options that are available are rendered less effective in the likely incidence of comorbid Major
Depressive Disorder. This study will provide insight into a shared biological mechanism that has
been implicated in both Cannabis Use Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder which may be specifically
involved in relapse. Results from this study can then be applied to future medications development for
comorbid Major Depressive Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder.

<b>Endocannabinoid Dysregulation in Cannabis Dependence and Acute Cannabis Withdrawal</b>

This is a pilot trial examining the impact of regular cannabis use vs. cannabis withdrawal on plasma endocannabinoid levels (AEA, 2-AG) in people with cannabis use disorder. Aims of this project include evaluating changes in circadian rhythmicity due to withdrawal, determining if subjective withdrawal symptom expression is associated with endocannabinoid tone, and assessing potential sex differences in endocannabinoid levels during both use-as-usual and withdrawal periods. Results may be used to inform development of pharmacotherapeutics that target the endocannabinoid system.

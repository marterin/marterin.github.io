<b>Endocannabinoid Dysregulation in Cannabis Dependence and Acute Cannabis Withdrawal</b>

This is a pilot trial examining the impact of regular cannabis use vs. cannabis withdrawal on plasma endocannabinoid levels (AEA, 2-AG) in people with cannabis use disorder. Aims of this project include evaluating changes in circadian rhythmicity due to withdrawal, determining if subjective withdrawal symptom expression is associated with endocannabinoid tone, and assessing potential sex differences in endocannabinoid levels during both use-as-usual and withdrawal periods. Results may be used to inform development of pharmacotherapeutics that target the endocannabinoid system.
